2.000000	2.125000	effective but too-tepid biopic
2.000000	2.015862	steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges ; it's so clever you want to hate it ; but he somehow pulls it off ; 
1.000000	2.250000	illuminating if overly talky documentary ; 
1.000000	2.035156	though everything might be literate and smart , it never took off and always seemed static ; 
2.000000	2.503906	cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies , two-lane highways , and roadside cafes that permeate vincent's days
1.000000	2.007812	'compleja e intelectualmente retadora , el ladrón de orquídeas es uno de esos filmes que vale la pena ver precisamente por su originalidad ; '
1.000000	2.001892	may be spoofing an easy target -- those old '50's giant creature features -- but ; ; ; it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today ; 
1.000000	2.041016	behind the snow games and lovable siberian huskies ( plus one sheep dog ) , the picture hosts a parka-wrapped dose of heart ; 
2.000000	2.007854	you'd think by now america would have had enough of plucky british eccentrics with hearts of gold ; yet the act is still charming here ; 
1.000000	2.016602	morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but morvern callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start ; 
1.000000	2.033203	son of the bride may be a good half-hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness ; 
1.000000	2.003906	like the film's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early-'80s suburbia , it's significant without being overstated ; 
1.000000	2.045898	writer-director burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear ; 
1.000000	2.031250	chicago is sophisticated , brash , sardonic , completely joyful in its execution ; 
1.000000	2.033203	the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure ; 
1.000000	2.023438	if it's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then sl2 does just that ; 
1.000000	2.005859	4 friends , 2 couples , 2000 miles , and all the pabst blue ribbon beer they can drink - it's the ultimate redneck road-trip ; 
1.000000	2.003906	it's this memory-as-identity obviation that gives secret life its intermittent unease , reaffirming that long-held illusions are indeed reality , and that erasing them recasts the self ; 
2.000000	2.039062	between the drama of cube ? s personal revelations regarding what the shop means in the big picture , iconic characters gambol fluidly through the story , with charming results ; 
1.000000	2.027344	somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes ; 
1.000000	2.054688	a classy item by a legend who may have nothing left to prove but still has the chops and drive to show how its done ; 
1.000000	2.007812	as lo-fi as the special effects are , the folks who cobbled nemesis together indulge the force of humanity over hardware in a way that george lucas has long forgotten ; 
1.000000	2.010254	its mysteries are transparently obvious , and it's too slowly paced to be a thriller ; [but it's] worth recommending because of two marvelous performances by michael caine and brendan fraser ; 
1.000000	2.017090	the film is faithful to what one presumes are the book's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents , but we have no idea who they were at our age ; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are ; 
1.000000	2.054688	for a good chunk of its running time , trapped is an effective and claustrophobic thriller ; 
1.000000	2.000837	maybe it's just because this past year has seen the release of some of the worst film comedies in decades ; ; ; but honestly , analyze that really isn't all that bad ; 
1.000000	2.000244	britney has been delivered to the big screen safe and sound , the way we like our 20-year-old superstar girls to travel on the fame freeway ; 
1.000000	2.037109	the kind of nervous film that will either give you a mild headache or exhilarate you ; 
1.000000	2.027344	watching beanie and his gang put together his slasher video from spare parts and borrowed materials is as much fun as it must have been for them to make it ; 
1.000000	2.153280	children may not understand everything that happens -- i'm not sure even miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted ; 
2.000000	2.046875	all but the most persnickety preteens should enjoy this nonthreatening but thrilling adventure ; 
1.000000	2.269531	polished korean political-action film is just as good -- and bad -- as hollywood action epics ; is this progress ? 
1.000000	2.000488	elling , portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by per christian ellefsen , is a truly singular character , one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone ; 
1.000000	2.001312	the passions aroused by the discord between old and new cultures are set against the strange , stark beauty of the mideast desert , so lovingly and perceptively filmed that you can almost taste the desiccated air ; 
1.000000	2.002054	never mind whether you buy the stuff about barris being a cia hit man ; the kooky yet shadowy vision clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive ; 
1.000000	2.037435	behan himself knew how to spin a tale and one can't help but think he'd appreciate this attempt to turn his life into art ; 
1.000000	2.046890	though mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a jules and jim for the new millennium ; 
1.000000	2.017578	windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live ; 
1.000000	2.000244	using his audience as a figurative port-of-call , dong pulls his even-handed ideological ship to their dock for unloading , before he continues his longer journey still ahead ; 
1.000000	2.062500	the transporter is as lively and as fun as it is unapologetically dumb
1.000000	2.004150	as a witness to several greek-american weddings -- but , happily , a victim of none -- i can testify to the comparative accuracy of ms ; vardalos' memories and insights ; 
2.000000	2.000244	has it ever been possible to say that williams has truly inhabited a character ? it is now ; 
1.000000	2.125031	 " its successes are also tempered with elements which prove the direct antithesis of what it gets right ; " 
1.000000	2.004150	thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality ; ; ; takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the croc hunter agenda ; 
1.000000	2.000244	ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life's stasis ; 
1.000000	2.013916	if you're like me , a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat , then mostly martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite ; 
1.000000	2.031250	it would be interesting to hear from the other side , but in talk to her , the women are down for the count ; 
1.000000	2.013794	 ; ; ; if you're in a mind set for goofy comedy , the troopers will entertain with their gross outs , bawdy comedy and head games ; 
2.000000	2.125000	the new guy does have a heart ; now , if it only had a brain ; 
2.000000	2.007812	a savvy exploration of paranoia and insecurity in america's culture of fear ; 
1.000000	2.229167	the film's greatest asset is how much it's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture ; 
1.000000	2.001831	asia authors herself as anna battista , an italian superstar and aspiring directress who just happens to be her own worst enemy ; 
1.000000	2.002604	easier to respect than enthuse over , andersson's rigorous personal vision is not only distanced but distancing ; 
1.000000	2.093750	 ; ; ; tunney is allowed to build an uncommonly human character , an almost real-live girl complete with trouble and hope ; 
2.000000	2.500000	clever , brutal and strangely soulful movie ; 
2.000000	2.037109	attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage ; 
1.000000	2.095703	audiences conditioned to getting weepy over saucer-eyed , downy-cheeked moppets and their empathetic caretakers will probably feel emotionally cheated by the film's tart , sugar-free wit ; 
1.000000	2.015625	bennett's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that's tough to shake ; 
2.000000	2.354167	yeah , these flicks are just that damn good ; isn't it great ? 
1.000000	2.032227	if there's nothing fresh about wannabes , which was written by mr ; demeo , who produced and directed the film with charles a ; addessi , much of the time the movie feels authentic ; 
1.000000	2.158203	 ; ; ; the gentle melding of drama and comedy makes " what time is it there ? " something the true film buff will enjoy ; 
1.000000	2.002441	chalk it up to my adoration for both de niro and murphy , but i had a pretty good time with this movie - despite its myriad flaws ; 
2.000000	2.046875	most impressive , though , is the film's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters' emotional wounds ; 
1.000000	2.001991	the whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like bellini and mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by ; 
1.000000	2.000977	whether kiss is a future cult classic or destined to be completely forgotten is open to question , but the risk-takers in the crowd should check it out and form their own opinion ; 
1.000000	2.049932	the sundance film festival has become so buzz-obsessed that fans and producers descend upon utah each january to ferret out the next great thing ; 'tadpole' was one of the films so declared this year , but it's really more of the next pretty good thing ; 
1.000000	2.250000	recalls quiet freak-outs like l'avventura and repulsion ; 
1.000000	2.000999	 ; ; ; as the story congeals you feel the pieces of the star wars saga falling into place in a way that makes your spine tingle with revelation and excitement ; 
1.000000	2.000183	[villeneuve] seems to realize intuitively that even morality is reduced to an option by the ultimate mysteries of life and death ; 
1.000000	2.132996	the pleasures of super troopers may be fleeting , but they'll register strongly with anybody who still retains a soft spot for precollegiate humor ; 
1.000000	2.001953	what might have been a predictably heartwarming tale is suffused with complexity ; 
1.000000	2.250000	like old myths and wonder tales spun afresh ; 
1.000000	2.016602	one scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce ; 
1.000000	2.015625	one of [herzog's] least inspired works ; 
1.000000	2.109360	this boisterous comedy serves up a cruel reminder of the fate of hundreds of thousands of chinese , one which can only qualify as a terrible tragedy ; 
2.000000	2.007812	few films this year have been as resolute in their emotional nakedness ; 
2.000000	2.007812	a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido ; 
1.000000	2.031250	this version's no classic like its predecessor , but its pleasures are still plentiful ; 
2.000000	2.000244	the bourne identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups ; 
1.000000	2.009277	if it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right ; 
1.000000	2.312500	too sincere to exploit its subjects and too honest to manipulate its audience ; 
1.000000	2.015625	 ; ; ; a weak , manipulative , pencil-thin story that is miraculously able to entertain anyway ; 
1.000000	2.000854	effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience ; 
1.000000	2.125000	several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare ; 
1.000000	2.124023	this romantic thriller is steeped in the atmosphere of wartime england , and ably captures the speech patterns , moral codes and ideals of the 1940s ; 
1.000000	2.001465	we need [moore's] noisy , cocky energy , his passion and class consciousness ; we need his shticks , we need his stones ; 
1.000000	2.125244	[gai] comes closer to any actress i can remember to personifying independence in its purest and , yes , most intimidating form ; 
1.000000	2.015625	this version incarnates the prophetic book in a way even its exacting author might admire ; 
1.000000	2.000122	it suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media ; ; ; to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like hatfield and hicks ; 
1.000000	2.062500	the warm presence of zhao benshan makes the preposterous lying hero into something more than he reasonably should be ; 
1.000000	2.004150	despite a story predictable enough to make the sound of music play like a nail-biting thriller , its heart is so much in the right place it is difficult to get really peeved at it ; 
1.000000	2.000081	do we really need a 77-minute film to tell us exactly why a romantic relationship between a 15-year-old boy and a 40-year-old woman doesn't work ? 
1.000000	2.140625	when your leading ladies are a couple of screen-eating dominatrixes like goldie hawn and susan sarandon at their raunchy best , even hokum goes down easily ; 
1.000000	2.125000	no wonder they're talking about " talk to her ; " it's astonishing ; 
1.000000	2.190918	the film benefits greatly from a less manic tone than its predecessor , as cho appears to have settled comfortably into her skin ; 
2.000000	2.001953	the movie sticks much closer to hornby's drop-dead confessional tone than the film version of high fidelity did ; 
1.000000	2.039062	a pleasant ramble through the sort of idoosyncratic terrain that errol morris has often dealt with ; ; ; it does possess a loose , lackadaisical charm ; 
1.000000	2.068354	 ; ; ; spiced with humor ( 'i speak fluent flatula , ' advises denlopp after a rather , er , bubbly exchange with an alien deckhand ) and witty updatings ( silver's parrot has been replaced with morph , a cute alien creature who mimics everyone and everything around ) 
1.000000	2.032227	it's the kind of pigeonhole-resisting romp that hollywood too rarely provides ; 
2.000000	2.007812	a movie for 11-year-old boys with sports dreams of their own and the preteen girls who worship lil' bow wow ; 
2.000000	2.097656	whether seen on a 10-inch television screen or at your local multiplex , the edge-of-your-seat , educational antics of steve irwin are priceless entertainment ; 
2.000000	2.013184	not as distinctive or even as humorous as its needs to be to stand out , but it has clearly been made with affection and care ; 
1.000000	2.062500	es divertida , visualmente espectacular y muy entretenida ; simple y sencillamente te sorprenderá ; 
1.000000	2.499512	happily for mr ; chin -- though unhappily for his subjects -- the invisible hand of the marketplace wrote a script that no human screenwriter could have hoped to match ; 
1.000000	2.001953	[fessenden] is much more into ambiguity and creating mood than he is for on screen thrills
1.000000	2.007812	at nearly three hours , the whole of safe conduct is less than the sum of its parts ; 
2.000000	2.033813	it is so refreshing to see robin williams turn 180 degrees from the string of insultingly innocuous and sappy fiascoes he's been making for the last several years ; 
1.000000	2.007324	the film is just a big , gorgeous , mind-blowing , breath-taking mess ; 
1.000000	2.125000	a recent favourite at sundance , this white-trash satire will inspire the affection of even those unlucky people who never owned a cassette of def leppard's pyromania ; 
1.000000	2.039551	the recording session is the only part of the film that is enlightening -- and how appreciative you are of this depends on your level of fandom ; 
1.000000	2.136963	the 3d images only enhance the film's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen ; 
1.000000	2.265625	as hugh grant says repeatedly throughout the movie , 'lovely ! brilliant ! '
1.000000	2.000061	about nowhere kids who appropriated turfs as they found them and become self-made celebrity athletes -- a low-down version of the american dream ; 
1.000000	2.003906	 " 13 conversations " holds its goodwill close , but is relatively slow to come to the point ; 
1.000000	2.265625	full frontal is the antidote for soderbergh fans who think he's gone too commercial since his two oscar nominated films in 2000
0.000000	2.033691	más sarcástica , divertida y demencial que su predecesora , es un buen ejemplo de lo que es el cine de entretenimiento puro y sin complejos ; 
1.000000	2.000977	it's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be ; but it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as its unusual relationship slowly unfolds ; 
1.000000	2.020508	 ; ; ; a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920's ; ; ; the film's ending has a " what was it all for ? " feeling to it , but like the 1920's , the trip there is a great deal of fun ; 
1.000000	2.046875	like its two predecessors , 1983's koyaanisqatsi and 1988's powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever ; 
1.000000	2.017578	here , adrian lyne comes as close to profundity as he is likely to get ; 
1.000000	2.048889	evokes a little of the fear that parents have for the possible futures of their children--and the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good ; 
2.000000	2.015625	this concoction , so bizarre to the adult mind , is actually a charming triumph where its intended under-12 audience is concerned ; 
2.000000	2.001587	droll caper-comedy remake of " big deal on madonna street " that's a sly , amusing , laugh-filled little gem in which the ultimate " bellini " begins to look like a " real kaputschnik ; " 
1.000000	2.001953	the story , like life , refuses to be simple , and the result is a compelling slice of awkward emotions ; 
2.000000	2.128906	those with an interest in new or singular sorts of film experiences will find what time is it there ? well worth the time ; 
1.000000	2.074219	the reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies ; 
1.000000	2.025391	it is ridiculous , of course ; ; ; but it is also refreshing , disarming , and just outright enjoyable despite its ridiculousness ; 
2.000000	2.125000	reinforces the talents of screenwriter charlie kaufman , creator of adaptation and being john malkovich ; 
1.000000	2.126953	 ; ; ; a joke at once flaky and resonant , lightweight and bizarrely original ; 
1.000000	2.079102	dazzling and sugar-sweet , a blast of shallow magnificence that only sex , scandal , and a chorus line of dangerous damsels can deliver ; 
2.000000	2.062363	cuts right through the b ; s ; giving a big middle-fingered " shut up " to those who talk up what is nothing more than two guys beating the hell outta one another ; 
1.000000	2.031616	throwing caution to the wind with an invitation to the hedonist in us all , nair has constructed this motion picture in such a way that even the most cynical curmudgeon with find himself or herself smiling at one time or another ; 
1.000000	2.031250	makes an aborbing if arguable case for the man's greatness ; 
2.000000	2.117188	the long-range appeal of " minority report " should transcend any awards it bags ; this is one for the ages ; 
1.000000	2.009766	[hawn's character]is so bluntly written , without a trace of sentimentality , and so blisteringly defined , that every other character seems overlooked and underwritten ; 
1.000000	2.003906	the heightened symmetry of this new/old cinema paradiso makes the film a fuller experience , like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time ; 
1.000000	2.127808	the powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question ; but this time there's some mold on the gold ; 
1.000000	2.002930	reign of fire may be little more than another platter of reheated aliens , but it's still pretty tasty ; 
2.000000	2.004951	there are times when a rumor of angels plays like an extended episode of touched by an angel -- a little too much dancing , a few too many weeping scenes -- but i liked its heart and its spirit ; 
1.000000	2.002686	two hours of melodramatic musical married to two hours of underdog sports intrigue , if the picture also shares the weaknesses of both genres , more's the pity ; 
1.000000	2.058594	more honest about alzheimer's disease , i think , than iris ; 
2.000000	2.000977	the two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath ; ; ; 
1.000000	2.004883	after making several adaptations of other writers' work , armenian-canadian director atom egoyan broached an original treatment of a deeply personal subject ; 
1.000000	2.054688	the film is painfully authentic , and the performances of the young players are utterly convincing ; 
1.000000	2.062805	without resorting to hyperbole , i can state that kissing jessica stein may be the best same-sex romance i have seen ; 
2.000000	2.001953	[howard] so good as leon barlow ; ; ; that he hardly seems to be acting ; 
1.000000	2.001953	the weakest of the four harry potter books has been transformed into the stronger of the two films by the thinnest of margins ; 
0.000000	2.007812	its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces ; ; ; are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half ; still , it gets the job done -- a sleepy afternoon rental ; 
2.000000	2.031250	it took 19 predecessors to get this ? 
1.000000	2.015625	even when foreign directors ; ; ; borrow stuff from hollywood , they invariably shake up the formula and make it more interesting ; 
1.000000	2.022461	a cockamamie tone poem pitched precipitously between swoony lyricism and violent catastrophe ; ; ; the most aggressively nerve-wracking and screamingly neurotic romantic comedy in cinema history ; 
2.000000	2.007812	flawed but worthy look at life in u ; s ; relocation camps ; 
1.000000	2.066643	you'll gasp appalled and laugh outraged and possibly , watching the spectacle of a promising young lad treading desperately in a nasty sea , shed an errant tear ; 
1.000000	2.064453	as surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph , as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming ; 
1.000000	2.001984	[lawrence bounces] all over the stage , dancing , running , sweating , mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place ; 
1.000000	2.005859	the film serves as a valuable time capsule to remind us of the devastating horror suffered by an entire people ; 
2.000000	2.032715	 ; ; ; an otherwise intense , twist-and-turn thriller that certainly shouldn't hurt talented young gaghan's resume ; 
1.000000	2.025045	it moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ; it doesn't give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the cold war datedness -- of its premise ; 
2.000000	2.000244	in a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in ; 
1.000000	2.113159	a celebration of quirkiness , eccentricity , and certain individuals' tendency to let it all hang out , and damn the consequences ; 
1.000000	2.093750	makes even the claustrophobic on-board quarters seem fun ;

1.000000	2.036377	what's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller is the director's talent ; watching a brian depalma movie is like watching an alfred hitchcock movie after drinking twelve beers ; 
1.000000	2.001953	this familiar rise-and-fall tale is long on glamour and short on larger moralistic consequences , though it's told with sharp ears and eyes for the tenor of the times ;

1.000000	2.002930	this cinema verite speculation on the assassination of john f ; kennedy may have been inspired by blair witch , but it takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative ;

2.000000	2.056641	with its hint of an awkward hitchcockian theme in tact , harmon's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone

1.000000	2.003387	the film is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders , but deftly manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill ; 
1.000000	2.091553	the faithful will enjoy this sometimes wry adaptation of v ; s ; naipaul's novel , but newcomers may find themselves stifling a yawn or two during the first hour ;

1.000000	2.000977	most thrillers send audiences out talking about specific scary scenes or startling moments ; " frailty " leaves us with the terrifying message that the real horror may be waiting for us at home ;

1.000000	2.062439	for most of its footage , the new thriller proves that director m ; night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo ; 
1.000000	2.008301	while this gentle and affecting melodrama will have luvvies in raptures , it's far too slight and introspective to appeal to anything wider than a niche audience ; 
2.000000	2.031189	a difficult but worthy film that bites off more than it can chew by linking the massacre of armenians in 1915 with some difficult relationships in the present ; 
1.000000	2.019165	some of the most ravaging , gut-wrenching , frightening war scenes since " saving private ryan " have been recreated by john woo in this little-known story of native americans and their role in the second great war ;

1.000000	2.030396	what could have easily become a cold , calculated exercise in postmodern pastiche winds up a powerful and deeply moving example of melodramatic moviemaking ; 
2.000000	2.016602	although devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants , dogtown and z-boys has a compelling story to tell ;

1.000000	2.062866	for 95 often hilarious minutes , [cho] riffs on the diciness of colonics , on straight versus gay personal ads , on how men would act if they had periods , and on the perils of a certain outré sexual practice ; 
1.000000	2.015625	a film that's flawed and brilliant in equal measure ; 
1.000000	2.062500	hardly a film that comes along every day ; 
1.000000	2.063492	a flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds ;

2.000000	2.002930	meant for star wars fans ; it is there to give them a good time ; 
1.000000	2.001467	i like it ; there is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane ;

1.000000	2.004028	while bollywood/hollywood will undoubtedly provide its keenest pleasures to those familiar with bombay musicals , it also has plenty for those ( like me ) who aren't ;

1.000000	2.015137	[clooney's] debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but it has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh ;

1.000000	2.000432	this rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you hadn't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point ;

2.000000	2.025937	the result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from spielberg , who has never made anything that wasn't at least watchable ; but it's also disappointing to a certain degree ;

2.000000	2.061523	two weeks notice has appeal beyond being a sandra bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy ;

1.000000	2.031250	it is a strength of a documentary to disregard available bias , especially as temptingly easy as it would have been with this premise ;

1.000000	2.125244	in capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating , genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills , the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st ;
