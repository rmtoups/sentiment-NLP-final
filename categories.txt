POTENTIALLY MISCATEGORIZED IN CORPUS (out of scope)
P	VN	ultimately feels empty and unsatisfying , like swallowing a communion wafer without the wine . 
P	VN	an uncomfortable movie , suffocating and sometimes almost senseless , the grey zone does have a center , though a morbid one . 
P	VN	' . . . the film's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '
N	VP	the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack . 
N	VP	it's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly . 
N	VP	the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast . 
N	VP	the stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny . 
		
		
SARCASM (out of scope)
N	VP	this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy . 
N	P	such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us " the skulls " and last year's " rollerball . " enough said , except : film overboard ! 
N	P	a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers .

000000	1.705139	the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line ; 			*also fits in contrastive conjunctions
3.000000	1.865234	though its atmosphere is intriguing ; ; ; the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression ; 
3.000000	1.692708	diane lane's sophisticated performance can't rescue adrian lyne's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing ; 
2.000000	1.992188	it's like an all-star salute to disney's cheesy commercialism ; 
		
		
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
P	VN	a painfully funny ode to bad behavior . 
N	VP	the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power . 
N	VP	must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry . others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding . 
		
		
MISCELLANEOUS OUT OF SCOPE
P	VN	works because , for the most part , it avoids the stupid cliches and formulaic potholes that befall its brethren . 
		
		
REVIEW IS NOT IN ENGLISH (out of scope)
P	VN	más sarcástica , divertida y demencial que su predecesora , es un buen ejemplo de lo que es el cine de entretenimiento puro y sin complejos . 
P	VN	contando com uma premissa curiosa , o filme mergulha o espectador em um clima de forte suspense , culminando em um desfecho que certamente fica na memória . 
P	VN	en sí mismo el rey león es un espectáculo digno de contemplarse en cine , dvd o en su soberbio montaje teatral ; pero el hacerlo en la pantalla imax es una experiencia colosal . 
P	VN	obligada para impotentes , daneses , camareras italianas , profesores de idiomas , y todo aquel que desee una lengua para expresar su amor . 
P	VN	É uma pena que , mais tarde , o próprio filme abandone o tom de paródia e passe a utilizar os mesmos clichês que havia satirizado . 
P	VN	gran historia sobre el amor , la familia , la lealtad y la traición que seguramente se convertirá en un nuevo clásico del género . 
		
		
ANALOGY-BASED or FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE (out of scope)
P	VN	though it's not very well shot or composed or edited , the score is too insistent and the dialogue is frequently overwrought and crudely literal , the film shatters you in waves . 
N	VP	handled correctly , wilde's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice . here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked soufflé . 
N	VP	. . . about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season . 
N	VP	. . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course . 
		
		
NEGATION
P	VN	no worse a film than breaking out , and breaking out was utterly charming . 
P	VN	works because , for the most part , it avoids the stupid cliches and formulaic potholes that befall its brethren . 
		
CONTRASTIVE CONJUNCTION
P	VN	a mess , but it's a sincere mess . 
P	VN	lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child's interest and an adult's patience . but it also has many of the things that made the first one charming . 
N	VP	serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour . 
N	VP	part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole . 
N	VP	the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act . 
N	P	watching austin powers in goldmember is like binging on cotton candy . it's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied . 
N	P	woody allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody . but i had a lot of problems with this movie .

2.000000	1.957194	directors john musker and ron clements , the team behind the little mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space ; 
1.000000	2.046890	though mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a jules and jim for the new millennium ;

CONTRASTIVE CONJUNCTION AND NEGATION
P	VN	it's plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless . indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions . 
N	P	interesting , but not compelling .

THE MOVIE IS ABOUT NEGATIVlike the film's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early-'80s suburbia , it's significant without being overstated . E THINGS, SO "NEGATIVE" WORDS ARE USED TO MAKE A POSITIVE STATEMENT ABOUT ITS EMOTIONAL IMPACT?
P	VN	this starts off with a 1950's doris day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast . the first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year ! 
P	VN	succeeds where its recent predecessor miserably fails because it demands that you suffer the dreadfulness of war from both sides . 
P	VN	painful , horrifying and oppressively tragic , this film should not be missed . 
		
REVIEW IS NEUTRAL
P	VN	starts off with a bang , but then fizzles like a wet stick of dynamite at the very end . it's still worth a look . 
P	VN	same song , second verse , coulda been better , but it coulda been worse . 
P	VN	in the long , dishonorable history of quickie teen-pop exploitation , like mike stands out for its only partly synthetic decency . 
P	VN	a sloppy , amusing comedy that proceeds from a stunningly unoriginal premise . 
P	VN	the actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , for technical flaws to get in the way .

4/30 -- Rachel Toups

SECOND SENTENCE IS WEIGHTED MORE THAN FIRST
P	N	the story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that's even less plausible than the rest of the picture . much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride .

SEEMINGLY NEGATIVE QUALITIES ARE SEEN AS GOOD
P 	N 	in its ragged , cheap and unassuming way , the movie works . 
P	N	you'd think by now america would have had enough of plucky british eccentrics with hearts of gold . yet the act is still charming here .
