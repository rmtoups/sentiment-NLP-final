Stanford	new	review text
3.000000	1.981771	the gorgeously elaborate continuation of " the lord of the rings " trilogy is so huge that a column of words cannot adequately describe co-writer/director peter jackson's expanded vision of j ; r ; r ; tolkien's middle-earth ; 
3.000000	1.995850	though it is by no means his best work , laissez-passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them ; 
3.000000	1.997070	everytime you think undercover brother has run out of steam , it finds a new way to surprise and amuse ; 
3.000000	1.949219	this is the best american movie about troubled teens since 1998's whatever ; 
3.000000	1.937500	haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration ; 
4.000000	1.382965	painful to watch , but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year's most accomplished and riveting film performances ; 
3.000000	1.911133	if nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror ; 
3.000000	1.938538	on the surface , it's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with piesiewicz's and kieslowski's earlier work , films like the double life of veronique ; 
3.000000	1.986816	the film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today's cinema du sarcasm
3.000000	1.759766	unlike most teen flicks , swimming takes its time to tell its story , casts mostly little-known performers in key roles , and introduces some intriguing ambiguity ; 
3.000000	1.992188	it is nature against progress ; in fessenden's horror trilogy , this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale ; 
3.000000	1.914062	a sad , superior human comedy played out on the back roads of life ; 
4.000000	1.999268	waydowntown is by no means a perfect film , but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality ; 
3.000000	1.998901	if you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of " the isle " you'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else ; 
3.000000	1.941162	remains a solid , if somewhat heavy-handed , account of the near-disaster ; ; ; done up by howard with a steady , if not very imaginative , hand ; 
4.000000	1.734619	it's traditional moviemaking all the way , but it's done with a lot of careful period attention as well as some very welcome wit ; 
3.000000	1.958333	those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they don't really want to know ; 
3.000000	1.994141	whether you're moved and love it , or bored or frustrated by the film , you'll still feel something ; 
3.000000	1.910156	now trimmed by about 20 minutes , this lavish three-year-old production has enough grandeur and scale to satisfy as grown-up escapism ; 
4.000000	1.994792	visits spy-movie territory like a novel you can't put down , examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen , and keeps you guessing from first frame to last ; 
3.000000	1.996094	despite its many infuriating flaws -- not the least of which is amy's self-absorbed personality -- amy's o's honesty will win you over ; 
3.000000	1.822469	day is not a great bond movie , but it is a good bond movie , which still makes it much better than your typical bond knock-offs ; 
3.000000	1.973958	the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it doesn't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story ; i like the new footage and still love the old stuff ; 
3.000000	1.968424	you wouldn't call the good girl a date movie ( an anti-date movie is more like it ) , but when it's good , it's good and horrid ; 
3.000000	1.972782	parker holds true to wilde's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness ; 
3.000000	1.992676	what's most striking about this largely celebratory film ; ; ; is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an ikea world ; 
3.000000	1.992188	finally , a genre movie that delivers -- in a couple of genres , no less ; 
3.000000	1.998047	hu and liu offer natural , matter-of-fact performances that glint with sorrow , longing and love ; 
3.000000	1.829915	while this film is not in the least surprising , it is still ultimately very satisfying ; think of it as a sort of comfort food for the mind ; 
3.000000	1.920492	even if you can't pronounce " gyro " correctly , you'll appreciate much of vardalos' humor , which transcends ethnic boundaries ; 
3.000000	1.837036	as expected , sayles' smart wordplay and clever plot contrivances are as sharp as ever , though they may be overshadowed by some strong performances ; 
3.000000	1.734039	it's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , and satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but minority report delivers all that and a whole lot more ; 
3.000000	1.956706	bubba ho-tep is a wonderful film with a bravura lead performance by bruce campbell that doesn't deserve to leave the building until everyone is aware of it ; 
3.000000	1.733398	disney's live-action division has a history of releasing cinematic flotsam , but this is one occasion when they have unearthed a rare gem ; 
3.000000	1.988525	i complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again , but the bourne identity proves that a fresh take is always possible ; 
3.000000	1.999907	[taymor] utilizes the idea of making kahlo's art a living , breathing part of the movie , often catapulting the artist into her own work ; this isn't a new idea ; it's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion ; 
3.000000	1.983032	not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it ; 
3.000000	1.999390	there's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film ; ; ; or the emotional integrity of the performances ; 
3.000000	1.515625	not everything works , but the average is higher than in mary and most other recent comedies ; 
3.000000	1.992188	this road movie gives you emotional whiplash , and you'll be glad you went along for the ride ; 
3.000000	1.968750	an uneven but intriguing drama that is part homage and part remake of the italian masterpiece ; 
3.000000	1.236979	having never been a huge fan of dickens' 800-page novel , it surprised me how much pleasure i had watching mcgrath's version ; 
3.000000	1.669108	divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood may not be exactly divine , but it's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya , what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances ; 
3.000000	1.990885	 " antwone fisher " is an earnest , by-the-numbers effort by washington ; it won't rock any boats but is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking ; 
3.000000	1.850260	while the glass slipper doesn't quite fit , pumpkin is definitely a unique modern fairytale ; 
3.000000	1.717285	the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes ; 
4.000000	1.835620	an exceedingly clever piece of cinema ; another great Â‘what you don't see' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances
3.000000	1.996094	branagh , in his most forceful non-shakespeare screen performance , grounds even the softest moments in the angry revolt of his wit ; 
3.000000	1.941406	director rob marshall went out gunning to make a great one ; 
3.000000	1.935547	claude miller airs out a tight plot with an easy pace and a focus on character drama over crime-film complications ; 
4.000000	1.992691	it is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come ; 
3.000000	1.999878	it has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion ; it risks seeming slow and pretentious , because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise ; 
3.000000	1.765625	awkward but sincere and , ultimately , it wins you over ; 
3.000000	1.171549	isn't quite the equal of woo's best earlier work , but it's easily his finest american film ; ; ; comes close to recapturing the brilliance of his hong kong films ; 
3.000000	1.997070	as a belated nod to some neglected all-stars , standing in the shadows of motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative , revealing and richly entertaining ; 
3.000000	1.882812	this is carion's debut feature but his script and direction hums with a confidence that many spend entire careers trying to reach ; 
4.000000	1.984985	a bold and subversive film that cuts across the grain of what is popular and powerful in this high-tech age , speaking its truths with spellbinding imagery and the entrancing music of philip glass ; 
4.000000	1.997070	barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful ; 
3.000000	1.791016	the ending does leave you unfulfilled , but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece ; 
3.000000	1.804688	lilia's transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous , but abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth ; 
3.000000	1.843099	though the film's scenario is certainly not earthshaking , this depiction of fluctuating female sexuality has two winning lead performances and charm to spare ; 
3.000000	1.820964	bright seems alternately amused and disgusted with this material , and he can't help throwing in a few of his own touches ; 
3.000000	1.838338	the film's real appeal won't be to clooney fans or adventure buffs , but to moviegoers who enjoy thinking about compelling questions with no easy answers ; 
3.000000	1.984375	a deviant topical comedy which is funny from start to finish ; 
3.000000	1.260539	don't plan on the perfect ending , but sweet home alabama hits the mark with critics who escaped from a small town life ; 
3.000000	1.983887	a provocative movie about loss , anger , greed , jealousy , sickness and love ; 
3.000000	1.937500	boisterous and daft documentary ; 
4.000000	1.956055	it turns out to be a cut above the norm , thanks to some clever writing and sprightly acting ; 
3.000000	1.957682	lee jeong-hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that i couldn't help being captivated by it ; 
3.000000	1.999023	a map of the inner rhythms of love and jealousy and sacrifice drawn with a master's steady stroke ; 
3.000000	1.819173	though the controversial korean filmmaker's latest effort is not for all tastes , it offers gorgeous imagery , effective performances , and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding ; 
3.000000	1.997070	it's endearing to hear madame d ; refer to her husband as 'jackie' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer ; 
3.000000	1.860026	baran isn't the most transporting or gripping film from iran -- or , indeed , by its director -- but it's a worthy companion to the many fine , focused films emerging from that most surprising of nations ; 
3.000000	1.854818	is it a total success ? no ; is it something any true film addict will want to check out ? you bet ; 
3.000000	1.947510	a refreshingly honest and ultimately touching tale of the sort of people usually ignored in contemporary american film ; search it out ; 
3.000000	1.985596	 ; ; ; does such a fine job of engulfing you in its world and allying you with its characters' choices , good and ill , that its shortcomings are remembered only as an afterthought ; 
3.000000	1.500000	insomnia is involving ; still , i thought it could have been more ; 
3.000000	1.992188	a comprehensive and provocative film -- one that pushes the boundaries of biography , and challenges its audience ; 
3.000000	1.998047	a tale of horror and revenge that is nearly perfect in its relentless descent to the depths of one man's tortured soul ; 
3.000000	1.975586	interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe , hopkins and norton are a winning combination -- but fiennes steals 'red dragon' right from under their noses ; 
3.000000	1.988281	biggie and tupac is so single-mindedly daring , it puts far more polished documentaries to shame ; 
3.000000	1.774414	unlike the nauseating fictions peddled by such 'have-yourself-a-happy-little-holocaust' movies as life is beautiful and jakob the liar , the grey zone is honest enough to deny the possibility of hope in auschwitz ; 
4.000000	1.944661	the wwii drama is well plotted , visually striking and filled with enjoyably complex characters who are never what they first appear ; 
3.000000	1.984467	this time out , [sade] is an unsettlingly familiar figure -- in turns loyal and deceitful , responsible and reckless , idealistically selfless and coldly self-interested ; 
4.000000	1.744141	human resources was a good , straightforward tale , but time out is better ; it's haunting ; it's like a poem ; 
3.000000	1.999878	shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic ; 
3.000000	1.254883	not only is undercover brother as funny , if not more so , than both austin powers films , but it's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time ; 
3.000000	1.908976	while the stoically delivered hokum of hart's war is never fun , it's still a worthy addition to the growing canon of post-saving private ryan tributes to the greatest generation ; 
3.000000	1.750000	we know the plot's a little crazy , but it held my interest from start to finish ; 
3.000000	1.968750	a sober and affecting chronicle of the leveling effect of loss ; 
3.000000	1.971680	although occasionally static to the point of resembling a stage play , the film delivers a solid mixture of sweetness and laughs ; 
3.000000	1.750977	it's a coming-of-age story we've all seen bits of in other films -- but it's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity ; 
3.000000	1.973958	 ; ; ; a story we haven't seen on the big screen before , and it's a story that we as americans , and human beings , should know ; 
3.000000	1.992188	if you can stomach the rough content , it's worth checking out for the performances alone ; 
3.000000	1.951823	kinnear doesn't aim for our sympathy , but rather delivers a performance of striking skill and depth ; 
3.000000	1.999023	it's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of anna chancellor that makes this " two weddings and a funeral " fun ; 
3.000000	1.958496	the movie isn't just hilarious : it's witty and inventive , too , and in hindsight , it isn't even all that dumb ; 
3.000000	1.958984	ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff and made a rather sturdy , old-fashioned entertainment out of it ; 
3.000000	1.994141	for the most part , director anne-sophie birot's first feature is a sensitive , extraordinarily well-acted drama ; 
3.000000	1.993978	in all , this is a watchable movie that's not quite the memorable experience it might have been ; 
3.000000	1.930990	it has charm to spare , and unlike many romantic comedies , it does not alienate either gender in the audience ; 
3.000000	1.997396	it will not appeal to the impatient , but those who like long books and movies will admire the way it accumulates power and depth ; 
3.000000	1.996094	this tenth feature is a big deal , indeed -- at least the third-best , and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up , nicholas meyer's star trek vi : the undiscovered country ; 
3.000000	1.898763	even if you don't think [kissinger's] any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen , he'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch ; 
3.000000	1.835938	forgettable horror -- more gory than psychological -- with a highly satisfying quotient of friday-night excitement and milla power ; 
3.000000	1.907715	ramsay , as in ratcatcher , remains a filmmaker with an acid viewpoint and a real gift for teasing chilly poetry out of lives and settings that might otherwise seem drab and sordid ; 
3.000000	1.751465	it has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but it holds you with its outrageousness ; 
3.000000	1.986816	birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters ; 
3.000000	1.996582	it is the sheer , selfish , wound-licking , bar-scrapping doggedness of leon's struggle to face and transmute his demons that makes the movie a spirited and touching occasion , despite its patchy construction ; 
3.000000	1.755859	there's really only one good idea in this movie , but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache ; 
3.000000	1.816081	while undisputed isn't exactly a high , it is a gripping , tidy little movie that takes mr ; hill higher than he's been in a while ; 
3.000000	1.984375	a grimly competent and stolid and earnest military courtroom drama ; 
3.000000	1.940430	my big fat greek wedding uses stereotypes in a delightful blend of sweet romance and lovingly dished out humor ; 
3.000000	1.999756	it's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up , a terrific climax , and some nice chills along the way ; 
3.000000	1.999756	whether writer-director anne fontaine's film is a ghost story , an account of a nervous breakdown , a trip down memory lane , all three or none of the above , it is as seductive as it is haunting ; 
3.000000	1.861979	a taut psychological thriller that doesn't waste a moment of its two-hour running time ; 
3.000000	1.988281	there's a wickedly subversive bent to the best parts of birthday girl ; 
3.000000	1.902374	not the kind of film that will appeal to a mainstream american audience , but there is a certain charm about the film that makes it a suitable entry into the fest circuit ; 
3.000000	1.953125	there is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine ; 
3.000000	1.994400	all-in-all , the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us , but not necessarily with us ; 
3.000000	1.999146	an interesting story with a pertinent ( cinematically unique ) message , told fairly well and scored to perfection , i found myself struggling to put my finger on that elusive " missing thing ; " 
3.000000	1.988281	watching these eccentrics is both inspiring and pure joy ; 
3.000000	1.931396	by no means a slam-dunk and sure to ultimately disappoint the action fans who will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act , it still comes off as a touching , transcendent love story ; 
3.000000	1.854350	i encourage young and old alike to go see this unique and entertaining twist on the classic whale's tale -- you won't be sorry ! 
3.000000	1.949219	laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , no such thing is a fascinating little tale ; 
3.000000	1.957031	one of the best silly horror movies of recent memory , with some real shocks in store for unwary viewers ; 
3.000000	1.999939	the work of a filmmaker who has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them ; strange occurrences build in the mind of the viewer and take on extreme urgency ; 
3.000000	1.955566	old people will love this movie , and i mean that in the nicest possible way : last orders will touch the heart of anyone old enough to have earned a 50-year friendship ; 
3.000000	1.718750	time out is existential drama without any of the pretension associated with the term ; 
4.000000	1.765625	it's tough to watch , but it's a fantastic movie ; 
3.000000	1.926610	the real triumphs in igby come from philippe , who makes oliver far more interesting than the character's lines would suggest , and sarandon , who couldn't be better as a cruel but weirdly likable wasp matron ; 
3.000000	1.994141	the quirky drama touches the heart and the funnybone thanks to the energetic and always surprising performance by rachel griffiths ; 
3.000000	1.890625	dark and disturbing , yet compelling to watch ; 
3.000000	1.851562	enough may pander to our basest desires for payback , but unlike many revenge fantasies , it ultimately delivers ; 
3.000000	1.960775	cho's latest comic set isn't as sharp or as fresh as i'm the one that i want ; ; ; but it's still damn funny stuff ; 
3.000000	1.906250	despite the film's shortcomings , the stories are quietly moving ; 
3.000000	1.999023	it's the filmmakers' post-camp comprehension of what made old-time b movies good-bad that makes eight legged freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion ; 
3.000000	1.985352	it strikes hardestÂ… when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain ; fifty years after the fact , the world's political situation seems little different , and [director phillip] noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill ; 
3.000000	1.998789	despite its shortcomings , girls can't swim represents an engaging and intimate first feature by a talented director to watch , and it's a worthy entry in the french coming-of-age genre ; 
3.000000	1.874634	[reno] delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion ; 
3.000000	1.605469	not everyone will welcome or accept the trials of henry kissinger as faithful portraiture , but few can argue that the debate it joins is a necessary and timely one ; 
3.000000	1.988281	an intense and effective film about loneliness and the chilly anonymity of the environments where so many of us spend so much of our time ; 
3.000000	1.921875	it's endlessly inventive , consistently intelligent and sickeningly savage ; 
3.000000	1.876953	a drama of great power , yet some members of the audience will leave the theater believing they have seen a comedy ; 
3.000000	1.982422	the last scenes of the film are anguished , bitter and truthful ; mr ; koshashvili is a director to watch ; 
3.000000	1.937500	it challenges , this nervy oddity , like modern art should ; 
4.000000	1.997192	bogdanovich puts history in perspective and , via kirsten dunst's remarkable performance , he showcases davies as a young woman of great charm , generosity and diplomacy ; 
3.000000	1.787760	those who aren't put off by the film's austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them ; 
3.000000	1.781250	strange it is , but delightfully so ; 
4.000000	1.726562	the movie is hardly a masterpiece , but it does mark ms ; bullock's best work in some time ; 
3.000000	1.520833	this beautifully animated epic is never dull ; 
3.000000	1.991699	it's burns' visuals , characters and his punchy dialogue , not his plot , that carry waydowntown ; 
3.000000	1.793620	while i can't say it's on par with the first one , stuart little 2 is a light , fun cheese puff of a movie ; 
3.000000	1.968750	strange , funny , twisted , brilliant and macabre ; 
4.000000	1.998535	wang xiaoshuai directs this intricately structured and well-realized drama that presents a fascinating glimpse of urban life and the class warfare that embroils two young men ; 
3.000000	1.996155	it's hard to imagine anybody ever being " in the mood " to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone , but it's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it's started ; 
3.000000	1.895833	even if you don't understand what on earth is going on , this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why ; 
3.000000	1.992157	this story still seems timely and important ; and there's an element of heartbreak to watching it now , with older and wiser eyes , because we know what will happen after greene's story ends ; 
3.000000	1.969360	though few will argue that it ranks with the best of herzog's works , invincible shows he's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film ;

3.000000	1.973755	the film's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled ; but Â… in trying to capture the novel's deeper intimate resonances , the film has Â– ironically - distanced us from the characters ; 
3.000000	1.912313	while not quite a comedy , the film tackles its relatively serious subject with an open mind and considerable good cheer , and is never less than engaging ;

3.000000	1.985352	the heart of the film is a touching reflection on aging , suffering and the prospect of death ; 
4.000000	1.796875	the movie is amateurish , but it's a minor treat ; 
3.000000	1.976562	witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy ; 
3.000000	1.833333	you're not merely watching history , you're engulfed by it ;

3.000000	1.797791	whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini dv , they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck ; 
3.000000	1.989583	 ; ; ; a rich and intelligent film that uses its pulpy core conceit to probe questions of attraction and interdependence and how the heart accomodates practical needs ; it is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual

3.000000	1.985352	despite its old-hat set-up and predictable plot , empire still has enough moments to keep it entertaining ; 
3.000000	1.841146	it's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it's entertaining enough and worth a look ; 
3.000000	1.985352	an unorthodox little film noir organized crime story that includes one of the strangest love stories you will ever see ; 
3.000000	1.982666	one of those terrific documentaries that collect a bunch of people who are enthusiastic about something and then figures out how to make us share their enthusiasm ;

3.000000	1.996094	hatfield and hicks make the oddest of couples , and in this sense the movie becomes a study of the gambles of the publishing world , offering a case study that exists apart from all the movie's political ramifications ; 
4.000000	1.789062	infidelity drama is nicely shot , well-edited and features a standout performance by diane lane ; 
3.000000	1.999512	'moore is like a progressive bull in a china shop , a provocateur crashing into ideas and special-interest groups as he slaps together his own brand of liberalism ; '

3.000000	1.974935	nohe's documentary about the event is sympathetic without being gullible : he isn't blind to the silliness , but also captures moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic co-operative interaction ; 
3.000000	1.996094	a keep-'em-guessing plot and an affectionate take on its screwed-up characters ; 
3.000000	1.937744	the last kiss will probably never achieve the popularity of my big fat greek wedding , but its provocative central wedding sequence has far more impact ; 
3.000000	1.972656	earnest , unsubtle and hollywood-predictable , green dragon is still a deeply moving effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of vietnamese ; 
4.000000	1.999941	in other words , it's just another sports drama/character study ; yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness ; plus , like i already mentioned ; ; ; it's robert duvall ! c'mon ! 
3.000000	1.502930	not everything in this ambitious comic escapade works , but coppola , along with his sister , sofia , is a real filmmaker ; it must be in the genes ; 
3.000000	1.997559	an old-fashioned scary movie , one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts ; 
3.000000	1.976562	it's weird , wonderful , and not necessarily for kids ; 
4.000000	1.503906	insomnia is one of the year's best films and pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances ; 
3.000000	1.996094	like vardalos and corbett , who play their roles with vibrant charm , the film , directed by joel zwick , is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you can't fake ; 
3.000000	1.999039	[has] an immediacy and an intimacy that sucks you in and dares you not to believe it's all true ; 
3.000000	1.950480	like mike isn't going to make box office money that makes michael jordan jealous , but it has some cute moments , funny scenes , and hits the target audience ( young bow wow fans ) - with nothing but net ; 
3.000000	1.995117	a headline-fresh thriller set among orthodox jews on the west bank , joseph cedar's time of favor manages not only to find a compelling dramatic means of addressing a complex situation , it does so without compromising that complexity ; 
3.000000	1.976318	the film , while not exactly assured in its execution , is notable for its sheer audacity and openness ; 
3.000000	1.974609	what bubbles up out of john c ; walsh's pipe dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie they might actually want to watch ; 
3.000000	1.957031	monte cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds ; 
3.000000	1.849264	nicole kidman evolved from star to superstar some time over the past year , which means that birthday girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while ; 
3.000000	1.971354	it's a visual delight and a decent popcorn adventure , as long as you don't try to look too deep into the story
4.000000	1.598958	one can't deny its seriousness and quality ; 
3.000000	1.996094	those who want to be jolted out of their gourd should drop everything and run to ichi ; 
3.000000	1.848958	sheds light on a subject few are familiar with , and makes you care about music you may not have heard before ; 
3.000000	1.969238	despite the film's bizarre developments , hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character's gripping humanity ; 
3.000000	1.992188	the auteur's ear for the way fears and slights are telegraphed in the most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug ; 
3.000000	1.769531	unlike lots of hollywood fluff , this has layered , well-developed characters and some surprises ; 
3.000000	1.999847	there are times when you wish that the movie had worked a little harder to conceal its contrivances , but brown sugar turns out to be a sweet and enjoyable fantasy ;

3.000000	1.776042	proves that some movie formulas don't need messing with -- like the big-bug movie ; 
3.000000	1.762370	if a big musical number like 'praise the lord , he's the god of second chances' doesn't put you off , this will be an enjoyable choice for younger kids ; 
3.000000	1.996094	the combination of lightness and strictness in this instance gives italian for beginners an amiable aimlessness that keeps it from seeming predictably formulaic ; 
4.000000	1.869792	this isn't exactly profound cinema , but it's good-natured and sometimes quite funny ; 
3.000000	1.974609	it gives devastating testimony to both people's capacity for evil and their heroic capacity for good ; 
3.000000	1.502930	not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe , but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions ; 
3.000000	1.968750	the leanest and meanest of solondz's misanthropic comedies ; 
3.000000	1.992188	a dark , quirky road movie that constantly defies expectation ;

3.000000	1.939453	it turns out to be smarter and more diabolical than you could have guessed at the beginning ; 
3.000000	1.855998	there aren't many conclusive answers in the film , but there is an interesting story of pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys vs ; the big guys ; 
4.000000	1.984856	the movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end ; 
3.000000	1.996216	leigh's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of margaret thatcher's ruinous legacy , he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other ; 
3.000000	1.812500	uneven but a lot of fun ; 
3.000000	1.827474	works because reno doesn't become smug or sanctimonious towards the audience ; 
3.000000	1.999023	cut through the layers of soap-opera emotion and you find a scathing portrayal of a powerful entity strangling the life out of the people who want to believe in it the most ; 
3.000000	1.998779	shot in rich , shadowy black-and-white , devils chronicles , with increasingly amused irony , the relationship between reluctant captors and befuddled captives ; 
3.000000	1.879883	with so many bad romances out there , this is the kind of movie that deserves a chance to shine ; 
3.000000	1.928304	though jackson doesn't always succeed in integrating the characters in the foreground into the extraordinarily rich landscape , it must be said that he is an imaginative filmmaker who can see the forest for the trees ; 
3.000000	1.590185	godard has never made a more sheerly beautiful film than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love , history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence ; 
3.000000	1.940104	unlike most surf movies , blue crush thrillingly uses modern technology to take the viewer inside the wave ; by the end you can't help but feel 'stoked ; '
3.000000	1.977051	brosnan gives a portrayal as solid and as perfect as his outstanding performance as bond in die another day ; 
3.000000	1.978516	if mostly martha is mostly unsurprising , it's still a sweet , even delectable diversion ; 
4.000000	1.718750	a miraculous movie , i'm going home is so slight , yet overflows with wisdom and emotion ; 
3.000000	1.972900	a b-movie you can sit through , enjoy on a certain level and then forget ; 
3.000000	1.499634	disappointingly , the characters are too strange and dysfunctional , tom included , to ever get under the skin , but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue , visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself ; 
3.000000	1.968750	the observations of this social/economic/urban environment are canny and spiced with irony ; 
3.000000	1.939453	 " the dangerous lives of altar boys " has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors
3.000000	1.965495	it's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture , and if it isn't entirely persuasive , it does give exposure to some talented performers ; 
3.000000	1.884766	not only does spider-man deliver , but i suspect it might deliver again and again ; 
3.000000	1.760498	skins has a desolate air , but eyre , a native american raised by white parents , manages to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor ; 
3.000000	1.958333	film can't quite maintain its initial momentum , but remains sporadically funny throughout ; 
3.000000	1.953613	o fantasma is boldly , confidently orchestrated , aesthetically and sexually , and its impact is deeply and rightly disturbing ; 
3.000000	1.982422	here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix ; 
3.000000	1.998535	this movie has the usual impossible stunts ; ; ; but it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie ; 
3.000000	1.972656	 ; ; ; the one thing this wild film has that other imax films don't : chimps , lots of chimps , all blown up to the size of a house ; that's fun for kids of any age ; 
3.000000	1.953125	although it lacks the detail of the book , the film does pack some serious suspense ; 
3.000000	1.908529	while cherish doesn't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller , it's got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem ; 
3.000000	1.999908	in many ways , reminiscent of 1992's unforgiven which also utilized the scintillating force of its actors to draw out the menace of its sparse dialogue ; 
3.000000	1.964844	this sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem ; 
3.000000	1.962891	i have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture , and , whatever flaws igby goes down may possess , it is undeniably that ; 
3.000000	1.971354	it's definitely an improvement on the first blade , since it doesn't take itself so deadly seriously ; 
3.000000	1.876953	it may be about drug dealers , kidnapping , and unsavory folks , but the tone and pacing are shockingly intimate ; 
3.000000	1.937500	if villainous vampires are your cup of blood , blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest ; 
3.000000	1.942383	because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we've somehow never seen before ; 
3.000000	1.937500	a terrific date movie , whatever your orientation ; 
3.000000	1.832031	not all of the stories work and the ones that do are thin and scattered , but the film works well enough to make it worth watching ; 
3.000000	1.999512	it's a hoot watching the rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire ! 
4.000000	1.997070	it is life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , funny and sad ; 
3.000000	1.984375	one of the film's most effective aspects is its tchaikovsky soundtrack of neurasthenic regret ; 
3.000000	1.994141	in an era where big stars and high production values are standard procedure , narc strikes a defiantly retro chord , and outpaces its contemporaries with daring and verve ; 
3.000000	1.969727	the film's gamble to occasionally break up the live-action scenes with animated sequences pays off , as does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter ; 
3.000000	1.863607	talk to her is not the perfect movie many have made it out to be , but it's still quite worth seeing ; 
3.000000	1.984375	a hidden-agenda drama that shouts classic french nuance ; 
3.000000	1.937997	for every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie's conception of a future-world holographic librarian ( orlando jones ) who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized ; 
3.000000	1.969238	beneath the film's obvious determination to shock at any cost lies considerable skill and determination , backed by sheer nerve ; 
3.000000	1.881714	nothing short of wonderful with its ten-year-old female protagonist and its steadfast refusal to set up a dualistic battle between good and evil ; 
3.000000	1.955200	mcgrath has deftly trimmed dickens' wonderfully sprawling soap opera , the better to focus on the hero's odyssey from cowering poverty to courage and happiness ; 
3.000000	1.972168	as directed by dani kouyate of burkina faso , sia lacks visual flair ; but kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them ; 
3.000000	1.969727	while maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among wiseman's warmest ; 
3.000000	1.970215	there is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country ; 
3.000000	2.000000	adam sandler ! in an art film ! 
3.000000	1.978027	even with all its botches , enigma offers all the pleasure of a handsome and well-made entertainment ; 
3.000000	1.999146	it's sobering , particularly if anyone still thinks this conflict can be resolved easily , or soon ; 
3.000000	1.911458	if it's not entirely memorable , the movie is certainly easy to watch ; 
3.000000	1.999878	if you've grown tired of going where no man has gone before , but several movies have - take heart ; this is the best star trek movie in a long time ; 
3.000000	1.765625	not only a coming-of-age story and cautionary parable , but also a perfectly rendered period piece ; 
3.000000	1.767578	not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time ; 
3.000000	1.897502	quiet , adult and just about more stately than any contemporary movie this year ; ; ; a true study , a film with a questioning heart and mind that isn't afraid to admit it doesn't have all the answers ; 
3.000000	1.683899	it's a good film , but it falls short of its aspiration to be a true 'epic' ; 
3.000000	1.996094	a tone of rueful compassion ; ; ; reverberates throughout this film , whose meaning and impact is sadly heightened by current world events ; 
3.000000	1.875732	it seems impossible that an epic four-hour indian musical about a cricket game could be this good , but it is ; 
3.000000	1.985352	boldly engineering a collision between tawdry b-movie flamboyance and grandiose spiritual anomie , rose's film , true to its source material , provides a tenacious demonstration of death as the great equalizer ; 
3.000000	1.917613	recoing's fantastic performance doesn't exactly reveal what makes vincent tick , but perhaps any definitive explanation for it would have felt like a cheat ; 
3.000000	1.986328	a perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little lilo & stitch had in spades -- charisma ; 
3.000000	1.984863	although largely a heavy-handed indictment of parental failings and the indifference of spanish social workers and legal system towards child abuse , the film retains ambiguities that make it well worth watching ; 
3.000000	1.999023	god bless crudup and his aversion to taking the easy hollywood road and cashing in on his movie-star gorgeousness ; 
3.000000	1.994202	[jeff's] gorgeous , fluid compositions , underlined by neil finn and edmund mcwilliams's melancholy music , are charged with metaphor , but rarely easy , obvious or self-indulgent ; 
4.000000	1.874939	delia , greta , and paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year ; as each of them searches for their place in the world , miller digs into their very minds to find an unblinking , flawed humanity ; 
3.000000	1.968750	boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy , kinky fun ; 
4.000000	1.799805	this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it ; 
3.000000	1.953125	the messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable , allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time ; 
3.000000	1.947917	it's never laugh-out-loud funny , but it is frequently amusing ; 
3.000000	1.988281	the unexplored story opportunities of " punch-drunk love " may have worked against the maker's minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer/director anderson ; 
3.000000	1.910645	good actors have a radar for juicy roles -- there's a plethora of characters in this picture , and not one of them is flat ; 
3.000000	1.875326	is not so much a work of entertainment as it is a unique , well-crafted psychological study of grief ; 
3.000000	1.906616	reno himself can take credit for most of the movie's success ; he's one of the few 'cool' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness ; 
3.000000	1.975207	i won't argue with anyone who calls 'slackers' dumb , insulting , or childish ; ; ; but i laughed so much that i didn't mind ; 
3.000000	1.912109	a mostly believable , refreshingly low-key and quietly inspirational little sports drama ; 
3.000000	1.893555	twenty years after its first release , e ; t ; remains the most wondrous of all hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of steven spielberg's misunderstood career ; 
3.000000	1.996338	a film that begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in san diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times i saw the film ; 
3.000000	1.976685	that the e-graveyard holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that chin's film serves up with style and empathy ; 
3.000000	1.968872	though the film is static , its writer-director's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable ; 
3.000000	1.948242	humorous , artsy , and even cute , in an off-kilter , dark , vaguely disturbing way ; 
3.000000	1.984497	together [time out and human resources] establish mr ; cantet as france's foremost cinematic poet of the workplace ; 
3.000000	1.520345	you can take the grandkids or the grandparents and never worry about anyone being bored ; ; ; audience is a sea of constant smiles and frequent laughter ; 
3.000000	1.922526	puts to rest any thought that the german film industry cannot make a delightful comedy centering on food ; 
4.000000	1.997477	<em>ash wednesday</em> is not edward burns' best film , but it is a good and ambitious film ; and it marks him as one of the most interesting writer/directors working today ; 
3.000000	1.278646	don't wait to see this terrific film with your kids -- if you don't have kids borrow some ; 
3.000000	1.994792	 ; ; ; even if you've never heard of chaplin , you'll still be glued to the screen ; 
3.000000	1.993164	it offers a glimpse of the solomonic decision facing jewish parents in those turbulent times : to save their children and yet to lose them ; 
3.000000	1.372396	may not be a breakthrough in filmmaking , but it is unwavering and arresting ; 
3.000000	1.999756	count on his movie to work at the back of your neck long after you leave the theater ; 
3.000000	1.984375	it may be a no-brainer , but at least it's a funny no-brainer ; 
3.000000	1.918162	the creative animation work may not look as fully 'rendered' as pixar's industry standard , but it uses lighting effects and innovative backgrounds to an equally impressive degree ; 
3.000000	1.994141	art-house to the core , read my lips is a genre-curling crime story that revives the free-wheeling noir spirit of old french cinema ; 
4.000000	1.804688	drama of temptation , salvation and good intentions is a thoughtful examination of faith , love and power ; 
3.000000	1.993490	some body will take you places you haven't been , and also places you have ; 
3.000000	1.968750	even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern ; 
3.000000	1.937500	as it turns out , you can go home again ; 
3.000000	1.875000	you've already seen city by the sea under a variety of titles , but it's worth yet another visit ; 
3.000000	1.697266	the main story ; ; ; is compelling enough , but it's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish ; 
3.000000	1.963542	hugh grant , who has a good line in charm , has never been more charming than in about a boy ; 
3.000000	1.937500	a gangster movie with the capacity to surprise ; 
3.000000	1.545573	it may not be particularly innovative , but the film's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding ; 
3.000000	1.996338	[scherfig] has made a movie that will leave you wondering about the characters' lives after the clever credits roll ; 
3.000000	1.948812	while it's nothing we haven't seen before from murphy , i spy is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it's more than a worthwhile effort ; 
3.000000	1.938151	an odd drama set in the world of lingerie models and bar dancers in the midwest that held my interest precisely because it didn't try to ; 
3.000000	1.988281	a captivating and intimate study about dying and loving ; ; ; 
3.000000	1.958781	this is an elegantly balanced movie -- every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do -- that doesn't reveal even a hint of artifice ; 
3.000000	1.992188	some of the most inventive silliness you are likely to witness in a movie theatre for some time ; 
3.000000	1.984375	canadian filmmaker gary burns' inventive and mordantly humorous take on the soullessness of work in the city ; 
3.000000	1.979309	everyone's insecure in lovely and amazing , a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers , daughters and their relationships ; 
3.000000	1.987000	in addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- lilo & stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded ; 
4.000000	1.984375	one of the most exciting action films to come out of china in recent years ; 
3.000000	1.871582	time out is as serious as a pink slip ; and more than that , it's an observant , unfussily poetic meditation about identity and alienation ; 
3.000000	1.781250	maryam is a small film , but it offers large rewards ; 
4.000000	1.977865	the wild thornberrys movie is pleasant enough and the message of our close ties with animals can certainly not be emphasized enough ; 
3.000000	1.994141	it's got all the familiar bruckheimer elements , and schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the hopkins/rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas ; 
3.000000	1.875000	dense , exhilarating documentary ; 
3.000000	1.910156	this submarine drama earns the right to be favorably compared to das boot ; 
3.000000	1.995110	the early and middle passages are surprising in how much they engage and even touch us ; this is not a classical dramatic animated feature , nor a hip , contemporary , in-jokey one ; it's sort of in-between , and it works ; 
3.000000	1.812500	spare but quietly effective retelling ; 
3.000000	1.974365	if you can keep your eyes open amid all the blood and gore , you'll see del toro has brought unexpected gravity to blade ii ; 
3.000000	1.875183	to call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement , and woe is the horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest ; 
3.000000	1.955729	i have a new favorite musical -- and i'm not even a fan of the genre
3.000000	1.507812	nothing short of a masterpiece -- and a challenging one ; 
3.000000	1.978027	twohy knows how to inflate the mundane into the scarifying , and gets full mileage out of the rolling of a stray barrel or the unexpected blast of a phonograph record ;
