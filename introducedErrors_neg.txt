Stanford	new	review text
1.000000	2.001953	[garbus] discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation ; 
1.000000	2.004150	about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time ; 
1.000000	2.031250	a sentimental mess that never rings true ; 
1.000000	2.058594	while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary ; 
1.000000	2.007812	this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material ; 
1.000000	2.015381	it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action ; 
1.000000	2.131348	as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma ; 
1.000000	2.132812	the party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks ; the rest of the film ; ; ; is dudsville ; 
1.000000	2.011658	the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story ; killing time , that's all that's going on here ; 
1.000000	2.003906	the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear ; 
1.000000	2.039062	the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable ; 
1.000000	2.005859	analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes , with a few new swings thrown in ; 
1.000000	2.000977	to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs ; sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement ; 
1.000000	2.000008	when seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , i wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , 'hey , kool-aid ! '
1.000000	2.123047	an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy ; 
1.000000	2.060547	pascale bailly's rom-com provides amélie's audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i ; e ; , a banal spiritual quest ; 
0.000000	2.000002	the biggest problem with roger avary's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director's cut glory , he's made a film that's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything ; 
1.000000	2.250000	sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house ; 
1.000000	2.001953	confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve ; 
1.000000	2.054688	with this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment ; 
1.000000	2.008347	one can only assume that the jury who bestowed star hoffman's brother gordy with the waldo salt screenwriting award at 2002's sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off
1.000000	2.047119	a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms ; 
1.000000	2.249992	sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler ; but never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti
1.000000	2.029297	a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers ; 
1.000000	2.125000	the code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute ; 
1.000000	2.029297	it's all pretty tame ; the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it ; 
1.000000	2.062500	in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar ; 
1.000000	2.062988	it's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget ; 
1.000000	2.062500	none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think ; 
1.000000	2.125000	a processed comedy chop suey ; 
1.000000	2.164062	full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in ; 
1.000000	2.129883	an erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either ; 
1.000000	2.125000	a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff ; 
1.000000	2.003581	it comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if ba , murdock and rest of the a-team were seen giving chase in a black and red van ; 
1.000000	2.002197	even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities ; 
0.000000	2.000610	what with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time ; 
1.000000	2.156250	plodding , peevish and gimmicky ; 
1.000000	2.008072	the four feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox ; 
1.000000	2.027344	though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch ; 
1.000000	2.000570	it has plenty of laughs ; it just doesn't have much else ; ; ; especially in a moral sense ; 
1.000000	2.006834	an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it ; 
1.000000	2.058105	it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding
1.000000	2.049683	putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest ; 
1.000000	2.123047	 at its best , it's black hawk down with more heart ; at its worst , it's rambo- meets-john ford ; 
1.000000	2.007812	it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject ; 
1.000000	2.064941	though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable ; 
1.000000	2.005859	it gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff ; 
1.000000	2.105469	an achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses ; 
1.000000	2.000488	it's tommy's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you'll feel like mopping up , too ; 
1.000000	2.008911	if you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign ; an exit sign , that is ; 
1.000000	2.000977	what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between ; 
1.000000	2.077799	stealing harvard doesn't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor ; 
1.000000	2.030502	there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening ; 
1.000000	2.061523	what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it's icky ; 
1.000000	2.007812	it's an 88-minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long ; 
1.000000	2.019531	the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) ; 
1.000000	2.046814	a suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre's most enabling victim ; ; ; and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers ; 
1.000000	2.125000	[n]o matter how much good will the actors generate , showtime eventually folds under its own thinness ; 
1.000000	2.132874	every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance , every performance respectably muted ; the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of rohypnol ; 
1.000000	2.000973	[p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting ; the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders ; 
1.000000	2.000374	parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone ; ; ; that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core ; 
1.000000	2.007812	bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side ; 
1.000000	2.113281	without shakespeare's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish ; 
1.000000	2.000488	if h ; g ; wells had a time machine and could take a look at his kin's reworked version , what would he say ? 'it looks good , sonny , but you missed the point ; '
1.000000	2.015625	the film can depress you about life itself ; 
1.000000	2.062500	here's my advice , kev ; start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line ; 
1.000000	2.006836	an alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom ; ; ; you'd be wise to send your regrets ; 
1.000000	2.015812	this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness ; 
1.000000	2.054688	a mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 8 1/2 ; 
1.000000	2.005371	to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved ; 
1.000000	2.581151	astonishing isn't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap ; indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild ; 
1.000000	2.015747	with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm ; 
1.000000	2.447744	to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again ; ; ; that in itself is commentary enough ; 
0.000000	2.054688	cuba gooding jr ; valiantly mugs his way through snow dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy ; 
1.000000	2.031250	silly , loud and goofy ; 
1.000000	2.000122	why spend $9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ? 
1.000000	2.107300	the french director has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing ; 
1.000000	2.011719	the basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy ; 
1.000000	2.009766	as is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr ; murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold ; 
1.000000	2.001302	it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , " look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! " but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging ; 
1.000000	2.017578	while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance ; ; ; and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context ; 
1.000000	2.055176	it's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun ; 
1.000000	2.000977	this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter ; 
1.000000	2.004883	there's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream ; 
0.000000	2.033231	it won't harm anyone , but neither can i think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it ; after all , it'll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies ; 
1.000000	2.000031	looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights ; 
1.000000	2.032623	it's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through ; 
1.000000	2.015625	brown's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie ; 
1.000000	2.000977	the script by vincent r ; nebrida ; ; ; tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot ; 
1.000000	2.078613	since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche ; 
1.000000	2.007812	the trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun ; 
1.000000	2.030762	in the wake of saving private ryan , black hawk down and we were soldiers , you are likely to be as heartily sick of mayhem as cage's war-weary marine ; 
1.000000	2.023438	and if you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest ; if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy ! 
1.000000	2.019287	directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length ; 
1.000000	2.035156	as an entertainment destination for the general public , kung pow sets a new benchmark for lameness ; 
1.000000	2.187500	as pure over-the-top trash , any john waters movie has it beat by a country mile ; 
1.000000	2.053711	wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time ; 
1.000000	2.000008	irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free ; 
1.000000	2.031250	to paraphrase a line from another dickens' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato ; 
1.000000	2.060547	the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood ; 
1.000000	2.015625	wait for it to hit cable ; 
1.000000	2.015625	john carlen's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling ; 
1.000000	2.039062	the big-screen scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well-crafted in comparison ; 
1.000000	2.021484	few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director neil burger follows up with are terribly convincing , which is a pity , considering barry's terrific performance ; 
1.000000	2.250000	gets better after foster leaves that little room ; 
1.000000	2.023438	devoid of any of the qualities that made the first film so special ; 
1.000000	2.140625	however sincere it may be , the rising place never quite justifies its own existence ; 
1.000000	2.007812	let's issue a moratorium , effective immediately , on treacly films about inspirational prep-school professors and the children they so heartwarmingly motivate ; 
1.000000	2.000180	it's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful ; 
1.000000	2.249062	the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration ; 
1.000000	2.093750	a close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late ; 
1.000000	2.042969	the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication ; 
1.000000	2.015625	only about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that reminds at every turn of elizabeth berkley's flopping dolphin-gasm ; 
1.000000	2.109436	it makes me feel weird / thinking about all the bad things in the world / like puppies with broken legs / and butterflies that die / and movies starring pop queens
1.000000	2.003906	'yes , that's right : it's forrest gump , angel of death ; '
1.000000	2.124985	about as enjoyable , i would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces ; ; ; positively dreadful ; 
1.000000	2.496094	surprisingly , considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy ; 
1.000000	2.000132	shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives ; 
1.000000	2.003906	a piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable ; 
1.000000	2.125732	labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public ; 
1.000000	2.125000	brisk hack job ; 
0.000000	2.035156	what little grace [rifkin's] tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics ; 
1.000000	2.033203	tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of animal house but instead comes closer to the failure of the third revenge of the nerds sequel ; 
1.000000	2.063477	a mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic jackie chan to even younger audiences ; 
1.000000	2.014648	the issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year's ( unintentionally ) funniest moments , that it's impossible to care ; 
1.000000	2.001394	a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics aren't likely to enter the theater ; 
1.000000	2.031250	there's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie ; 
1.000000	2.007690	although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks ; 
1.000000	2.008789	i've had more interesting -- and , dare i say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama ; 
1.000000	2.001953	when a movie asks you to feel sorry for mick jagger's sex life , it already has one strike against it ; 
1.000000	2.078400	soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable ; 
1.000000	2.023438	the only thing that distinguishes a randall wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film ; 
1.000000	2.123032	every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy ; half past dead is just such an achievement ; 
1.000000	2.010254	brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors ; ; ; by shoving them into every clichéd white-trash situation imaginable ; 
1.000000	2.005859	in the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , the emperor's club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach ; 
1.000000	2.093750	a direct-to-void release , heading nowhere ; 
1.000000	2.031250	there's something unintentionally comic in the film's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties ; 
1.000000	2.018066	in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life ; 
1.000000	2.011719	 ; ; ; contains very few laughs and even less surprises ; 
1.000000	2.031006	the actors must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face ; 
1.000000	2.013021	so devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it cannot even be dubbed hedonistic ; 
1.000000	2.000027	ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 ; zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
1.000000	2.205078	a pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole ; 
1.000000	2.007812	its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more ; 
1.000000	2.008057	instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence ; 
1.000000	2.000488	simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn ; 
1.000000	2.250000	too silly to take seriously ; 
1.000000	2.000244	some body often looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments ; 
1.000000	2.015625	despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from kathryn bigelow , the weight of water is oppressively heavy ; 
1.000000	2.005859	they were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they'd earn ; they were right ; 
1.000000	2.054688	offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life ; 
1.000000	2.048645	too ordinary to restore [harmon] to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience ; 
1.000000	2.090820	contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom ; 
1.000000	2.003377	frankly , it's kind of insulting , both to men and women ; and it's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting ; 
1.000000	2.078125	as happily glib and vicious as its characters ; 
1.000000	2.003906	one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart ; 
1.000000	2.062500	the new film of anton chekhov's the cherry orchard puts the 'ick' in 'classic ; '
1.000000	2.093750	has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together ; 
1.000000	2.001953	writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call 'too clever by half ; '
1.000000	2.007812	an awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating ; 
1.000000	2.063446	children , christian or otherwise , deserve to hear the full story of jonah's despair -- in all its agonizing , catch-22 glory -- even if they spend years trying to comprehend it ; 
1.000000	2.136658	with zoe clarke-williams's lackluster thriller " new best friend " , who needs enemies ? just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills ;

1.000000	2.250000	the comedy is nonexistent ;

0.000000	2.026367	despite bearing the paramount imprint , it's a bargain-basement european pickup ; what's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up ; wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there

1.000000	2.070312	in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a résumé loaded with credits like " girl in bar #3 ; " 
1.000000	2.007812	you really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this ; 
1.000000	2.015869	while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy ; 
1.000000	2.004028	the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows ;

0.000000	2.062500	a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers ; 
1.000000	2.002930	the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip ; the end result is a film that's neither ; 
1.000000	2.015594	every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable ; something like scrubbing the toilet ; or emptying rat traps ; or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife ;

1.000000	2.000488	is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ? 
1.000000	2.250895	the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original ; but it could have been worse ; 
1.000000	2.000732	even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor ; 
1.000000	2.062500	sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn ; 
1.000000	2.015594	schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character ;

0.000000	2.027832	a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against ; ; ; well , just stuff ; watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both ; instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy ; 
1.000000	2.001927	this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions ; 
1.000000	2.031250	consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
1.000000	2.038940	tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool , and too young is too cool ;

1.000000	2.130859	culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character ; 
1.000000	2.015625	a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you'd expect ; 
1.000000	2.129875	to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist ;

1.000000	2.000122	before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon ; 
1.000000	2.121155	the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin ; 
1.000000	2.017075	instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre ; but what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ? 
1.000000	2.023438	a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker ; 
1.000000	2.062500	flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as morvern's thick , working-class scottish accent ; 
1.000000	2.015629	it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u ; s ; art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that ; 
1.000000	2.016602	we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting ;

1.000000	2.035156	roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut ; 
1.000000	2.003866	there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal's character ; ; ; performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we're not watching a double ; 
1.000000	2.247681	ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive ; 
1.000000	2.001465	egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious ; 
1.000000	2.021484	shadyac shoots his film like an m ; night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension ; 
1.000000	2.007812	plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial ; 
1.000000	2.035156	an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent ; 
1.000000	2.000244	even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy ; ; ; even for disney ; 
1.000000	2.007812	that is essentially what's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point ; 
1.000000	2.125000	verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills ; 
1.000000	2.001953	for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer ; 
0.000000	2.105469	the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet ; 
1.000000	2.000488	the movie feels like it's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens ; 
1.000000	2.015625	 ; ; ; the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats ; 
1.000000	2.002930	it's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold ; 
1.000000	2.000363	there's plenty of style in guillermo del toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes ; 
1.000000	2.001953	[i]f you've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you've already seen this kind of thing ;

1.000000	2.000244	watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good ; 
1.000000	2.027344	it's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet ; 
1.000000	2.013702	there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject ;

1.000000	2.011230	the only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare ; 
1.000000	2.015656	the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave ; immediately ; 
1.000000	2.001465	[it's] a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy ;

1.000000	2.003967	feels like one of those contrived , only-in -hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk ; 
1.000000	2.015381	the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles ; 
1.000000	2.001221	each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception ;

1.000000	2.003906	though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work ; 
1.000000	2.001938	wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn ; 
1.000000	2.187500	this time kaufman's imagination has failed him ; 
1.000000	2.005859	it becomes gimmicky instead of compelling ; " interview " loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a tv episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into ; 
1.000000	2.007812	sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick , it's a sitcom without the snap-crackle ; 
1.000000	2.250000	the thrill is ( long ) gone ; 
1.000000	2.125000	just plain silly ; 
1.000000	2.124023	began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course ;

1.000000	2.014486	accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license ; 
1.000000	2.000015	with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams writer/director/producer robert rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry ; 
1.000000	2.023438	a hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations ; 
1.000000	2.237305	never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful ; 
1.000000	2.013083	oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven ; why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me ;

1.000000	2.078125	scotland , pa ; is a strangely drab romp ; some studio pizazz might have helped ; 
1.000000	2.000031	there's more scatological action in 8 crazy nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career ; 
1.000000	2.031250	the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy ; 
0.000000	2.016106	all ms ; jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters ; 
1.000000	2.234375	better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine ; 
1.000000	2.001139	it's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor ; 
1.000000	2.007812	the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun ; 
1.000000	2.062500	bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
1.000000	2.250000	the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome ; 
1.000000	2.125000	a ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes ; 
1.000000	2.031250	a little too pat for its own good ; 
1.000000	2.001953	there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them ; 
1.000000	2.220703	well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special ; 
1.000000	2.002930	it's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story ; 
1.000000	2.005859	a journey that's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which hoffman's brilliance almost makes worth taking ; 
0.000000	2.000651	but buying into sham truths and routine " indie " filmmaking , freundlich has made just another safe movie ; it's not horrible , just horribly mediocre ; 
1.000000	2.007812	you're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous ; 
1.000000	2.123779	some actors steal scenes ; tom green just gives them a bad odor ; this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he's the most obvious one ; 
1.000000	2.000977	sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well ; 
1.000000	2.062500	a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it ; 
1.000000	2.003830	the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone ; 
1.000000	2.000519	the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing ; 
1.000000	2.031311	opens as promising as any war/adventure film you'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled " glory : a soldier's story ; " 
1.000000	2.046875	a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan ; 
1.000000	2.000092	everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones ; 
1.000000	2.125000	its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent dumas botch-jobs , the man in the iron mask and the musketeer ; 
1.000000	2.031250	borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu ; 
1.000000	2.000977	the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low ; 
0.000000	2.123535	too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette ; 
1.000000	2.000267	it would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun ; 
1.000000	2.003906	all that ( powerpuff girls ) charm is present in the movie , but it's spread too thin ; 
1.000000	2.001526	 ; ; ; watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life ; and if the hours wins 'best picture' i just might ; 
1.000000	2.065918	despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum ; 
1.000000	2.004443	given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much ; 
1.000000	2.023438	it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original ; 
1.000000	2.001953	the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety ; 
1.000000	2.501960	good for a few unintentional laughs , " extreme ops " was obviously made for the " xxx " crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction ; 
1.000000	2.000977	a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason ; 
1.000000	2.061523	as written by michael berg and michael j ; wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all ; 
1.000000	2.000977	will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible qatsi siblings ; 
1.000000	2.005005	if you're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere ; 
1.000000	2.016602	it virtually defines a comedy that's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while ; 
1.000000	2.008057	like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , john q ; is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause ; 
1.000000	2.027344	the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven ; 
1.000000	2.015625	there's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about ; 
1.000000	2.032227	too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes ; 
0.000000	2.005859	when a film is created solely because it's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result ; let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested ; 
1.000000	2.000488	the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace ; 
1.000000	2.062012	if myers decides to make another austin powers movie , maybe he should just stick with austin and dr evil ; 
1.000000	2.000977	if this is satire , it's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook ; 
1.000000	2.007812	any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment ; 
1.000000	2.031250	the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction ; 
1.000000	2.003906	suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video ; 
1.000000	2.062988	newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept  a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman ; 
0.000000	2.039062	often silly  and gross  but it's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films ; 
1.000000	2.123901	the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap ; any rock pile will do for a set ; reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap ; 
1.000000	2.019531	a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men ; 
1.000000	2.061035	the best you can say about it is it's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now ; 
0.000000	2.066406	too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing ; 
1.000000	2.128906	the movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension ; 
1.000000	2.003784	though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis' nothing novel , in the end , his rules is barely worth following ; 
1.000000	2.014587	the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset ; 
1.000000	2.061523	the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) ; 
1.000000	2.027344	while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production ; 
1.000000	2.246012	lanie's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she's driven by ambition and doesn't know how to have fun ; 
1.000000	2.047852	so faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check ; 
1.000000	2.014648	i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent , and that's sultry linda fiorentino doing the same thing ; 
1.000000	2.007812	the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs ; 
1.000000	2.001465	like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness ; 
1.000000	2.005859	a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through ; 
1.000000	2.015869	the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory ; 
1.000000	2.001953	what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead ; 
1.000000	2.264327	cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i'm not one of them ; 
1.000000	2.009766	the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction ; 
1.000000	2.109375	so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun ; 
1.000000	2.123047	well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons ; 
1.000000	2.062500	if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna ; 
1.000000	2.015625	this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay ; 
0.000000	2.020508	the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year ; 
1.000000	2.001953	a restrained ribisi convinces as an italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones ;

0.000000	2.014221	director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a french poodle ;

0.000000	2.000061	filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low ; fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water ; 
1.000000	2.000732	i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness ; 
1.000000	2.003906	feels less like it's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers ; 
1.000000	2.062500	a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crème brûlée ; 
1.000000	2.019531	if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public ; 
1.000000	2.007812	places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller ; 
1.000000	2.003418	stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition  wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text  when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type ; 
1.000000	2.093750	a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness ;

1.000000	2.000122	as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure ; 
1.000000	2.000122	un thriller manqué qui tombe sur les nerfs presque dès la première image ;

1.000000	2.001961	none of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter ; 
1.000000	2.178711	as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame ; 
1.000000	2.103516	this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch ; but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away ; 
1.000000	2.000244	at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about ;

1.000000	2.043945	blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor ; and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy ;

1.000000	2.003925	if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps ; 
1.000000	2.000708	only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry ; 
1.000000	2.015625	when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you're in trouble ; 
1.000000	2.056641	though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention ; 
1.000000	2.025391	succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies ; 
1.000000	2.125244	 " men in black ii , " has all the earmarks of a sequel ; the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ?

1.000000	2.047852	this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on ; 
0.000000	2.002767	it's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie ; no , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else ; 
1.000000	2.000488	just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half ;

1.000000	2.499516	herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance ; 
1.000000	2.046875	secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny ;

1.000000	2.004395	the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect ; 
1.000000	2.000244	once the audience figure out what's being said , the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care ; 
1.000000	2.039070	the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ; ; ; in the thrall of a vicious hangover ; 
1.000000	2.125000	creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller ; 
1.000000	2.047028	you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production ; 
1.000000	2.010742	as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious ; 
1.000000	2.007568	for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry ; 
1.000000	2.093750	however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release ; 
1.000000	2.015625	here's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah ; 
1.000000	2.032104	a shambles of a movie--visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly ; ; ; its hilarity is completely unintentional ; 
1.000000	2.033188	de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork ; but like bruce springsteen's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins ; 
1.000000	2.060547	a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided ; 
1.000000	2.000651	city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes ; but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing ; 
1.000000	2.003845	what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama ; 
0.000000	2.023438	drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality ; 
1.000000	2.031250	a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement ; 
1.000000	2.032227	it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture ; 
1.000000	2.000488	take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo's cool jackets ; 
1.000000	2.003906	it's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time ;

1.000000	2.015808	the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted ; 
1.000000	2.001561	it's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who can't come up with legitimate funny , and it's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed ; 
0.000000	2.000488	watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives ; as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart ; 
1.000000	2.007935	the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team ; 
1.000000	2.031250	[sen's] soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions ; 
1.000000	2.062500	though certainly original in form , altar boys requires a taste for swamp thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score ; 
1.000000	2.008301	bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences ; 
1.000000	2.062500	this film is full of rabbits ; brimful ; but like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance ; 
1.000000	2.003784	i kept wishing i was watching a documentary about the wartime navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious hollywood hoo-ha ; 
0.000000	2.001709	the movie makes absolutely no sense ; its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ? 
1.000000	2.001709	the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them ; 
0.000000	2.000244	it's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff ;

1.000000	2.077148	without a strong script and energetic acting , dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor's home videos ; 
1.000000	2.306641	strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery ; 
1.000000	2.007812	with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv's defunct cleopatra 2525 ; 
1.000000	2.118652	not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed ; 
1.000000	2.002441	oft-described as the antidote to american pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough
1.000000	2.002930	half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder ; ; ; would be more at home on a daytime television serial ; 
1.000000	2.044434	writer/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it's disastrous and kate's jealous female friends become downright despicable ;

1.000000	2.002441	what begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film's end , a feminist action fantasy ; 
1.000000	2.000031	christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr ; feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic ; 
1.000000	2.007080	pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs ; 
1.000000	2.002665	hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world ; 
1.000000	2.257446	build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year ; 
1.000000	2.031250	rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down ; 
1.000000	2.015137	 ; ; ; has about 3/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor  but it's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake- of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity ; 
1.000000	2.001689	the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown ; 
1.000000	2.005859	none of this violates the letter of behan's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor ; 
1.000000	2.015625	a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick ; 
1.000000	2.000206	it's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo ; 
1.000000	2.015633	although god is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film ; 
1.000000	2.007812	the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing ; 
1.000000	2.011719	once she lets her love depraved leads meet , [denis'] story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle
1.000000	2.123291	call me a cynic , but there's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message ; 
1.000000	2.000031	i guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen ; 
1.000000	2.030762	will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr ; besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms ; shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic ; 
1.000000	2.496531	true to its animatronic roots : ; ; ; as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus ; ; ; 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation ; 
1.000000	2.000031	you come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that's at the center of the story ; 
1.000000	2.062500	has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool ; 
1.000000	2.014648	i think it was plato who said , 'i think , therefore i know better than to rush to the theatre for this one ; '
1.000000	2.001953	the kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books ; 
1.000000	2.001373	i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they're treading water at best in this forgettable effort ; 
1.000000	2.023438	except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made ; 
1.000000	2.000153	for the future , one hopes mr ; plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter ; 
1.000000	2.375000	originality is sorely lacking ; 
1.000000	2.057617	though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker's flailing reputation ; 
1.000000	2.001450	for a story set at sea , ghost ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed 'surprises ; '
1.000000	2.013672	there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ? 
1.000000	2.001122	what we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance ; 
1.000000	2.406250	just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love ; 
1.000000	2.011719	cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge ; 
0.000000	2.026367	when the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence ; 
1.000000	2.015625	it never rises to its clever what-if concept ; 
1.000000	2.015625	this angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in ordinary people ; 
1.000000	2.046875	el crimen del padre amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-catholic protestors ; 
1.000000	2.027344	the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises ; 
1.000000	2.013021	what madonna does here can't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once ; 
1.000000	2.001923	there's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do joan and philip's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery ; 
1.000000	2.032104	deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate ; 
1.000000	2.064354	it's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that's just too boring and obvious ; 
1.000000	2.032196	the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list ; 
1.000000	2.031250	the modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones ; 
0.000000	2.031250	uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth ; 
1.000000	2.017578	director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt's gentle , endearing 1975 children's novel ; 
1.000000	2.000122	mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values ; 
1.000000	2.017578	that frenetic spectacle [on the tv show] has usually been leavened by a charm that's conspicuously missing from the girls' big-screen blowout ; 
1.000000	2.046875	kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera ; 
1.000000	2.004883	sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff ; 
1.000000	2.021484	too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay ; 
1.000000	2.003906	broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient ; 
1.000000	2.062219	it made me realize that we really haven't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since ; ; ; well ; ; ; since last week's reign of fire ; 
1.000000	2.030029	sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it's geared toward an audience full of masters of both ; 
1.000000	2.118652	seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it's a sad , sick sight ; 
1.000000	2.013184	seemingly a vehicle to showcase the canadian's inane ramblings , stealing harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr ; drew barrymore ; 
1.000000	2.001953	the pairing does sound promising in theory ; ; ; but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners ; 
1.000000	2.000488	director chris eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking ; 
1.000000	2.007812	even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have ; 
1.000000	2.091797	despite hoffman's best efforts , wilson remains a silent , lumpish cipher ; his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before ; 
1.000000	2.062500	while some of the camera work is interesting , the film's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work ; 
1.000000	2.195312	sweet home alabama is one dumb movie , but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless that it almost wins you over in the end ; 
1.000000	2.001099	[green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u ; n ; and ask permission for a preemptive strike ; 
1.000000	2.007812	it is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by southern blacks as distilled through a caucasian perspective ; 
1.000000	2.001221	unofficially , national lampoon's van wilder is son of animal house ; officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny ; 
1.000000	2.014648	this is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie ; 
1.000000	2.109673	halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles ; it's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy ; 
1.000000	2.011719	will be far more interesting to the soderbergh faithful than it will be to the casual moviegoer who might be lured in by julia roberts ; ; ; 
1.000000	2.062317	follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun ; 
1.000000	2.066406	the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo ; 
1.000000	2.007812	has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies ; ; ; 
1.000000	2.250000	vaguely interesting , but it's just too too much ; 
1.000000	2.015625	a generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set ; 
1.000000	2.123047	 ; ; ; pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards--with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism ;

1.000000	2.003052	'butterfingered' is the word for the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach ; 
1.000000	2.255859	definitely in the guilty pleasure b-movie category , reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable ; 
1.000000	2.562500	entertaining enough , but nothing new
1.000000	2.250977	works better in the conception than it does in the execution ; ; ; winds up seeming just a little too clever ; 
1.000000	2.250000	observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom ; 
1.000000	2.004883	with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man's monster movie ; 
1.000000	2.000977	the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart ; 
1.000000	2.060547	needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion 'grandeur' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism ; 
1.000000	2.052734	disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances ; 
1.000000	2.044922	you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time ; 
1.000000	2.009766	yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit ;

1.000000	2.147461	finally coming down off of miramax's deep shelves after a couple of aborted attempts , waking up in reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping dogs lie ; 
1.000000	2.001953	a movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action tv series ; 
1.000000	2.003906	director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great ; 
1.000000	2.008247	the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes ( of which they'll get plenty ) fills me with revulsion ; 
1.000000	2.125488	a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone's crazy french grandfather ; 
1.000000	2.121745	i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon ; i also believe that resident evil is not it ; 
1.000000	2.000488	it has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition ; 
1.000000	2.027344	the plot meanders from gripping to plodding and back ; 
1.000000	2.061523	[taylor] takes us on a ride that's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb ; 
1.000000	2.037598	the most remarkable ( and frustrating ) thing about world traveler , which opens today in manhattan , is that its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank ; 
1.000000	2.125000	these characters become wearisome ; 
1.000000	2.039062	a hit- and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped ; 
1.000000	2.015625	the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog rover dangerfield ; 
1.000000	2.027344	like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless ; 
1.000000	2.058472	despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype ; 
1.000000	2.312500	qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating ; 
1.000000	2.493535	well , jason's gone to manhattan and hell , i guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , don't shoot the messenger ) ;

1.000000	2.005615	there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract ; 
1.000000	2.046875	bread , my sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it ; it may even fall into the category of films you love to hate ; i admit it , i hate to like it ; 
1.000000	2.108683	if you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you aren't very bright , then blood work is for you ; 
1.000000	2.001221	trouble every day is a success in some sense , but it's hard to like a film so cold and dead ; 
1.000000	2.062500	a well-intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility ; 
1.000000	2.013672	unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers ; 
1.000000	2.132812	a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece ; 
1.000000	2.257812	any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors ; 
1.000000	2.002930	 ; ; ; while the humor aspects of 'jason x' were far more entertaining than i had expected , everything else about the film tanks ; 
1.000000	2.125000	like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels ; 
1.000000	2.062683	while certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , jeong-hyang lee's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness ; 
1.000000	2.250000	a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions ; 
1.000000	2.023438	how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ? 
1.000000	2.074219	the somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make green dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment ; 
1.000000	2.050130	the filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they won't much care about ; 
1.000000	2.032227	another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures ; 
0.000000	2.038086	features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory ; 
1.000000	2.054688	a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged ; 
1.000000	2.001953	none of birthday girl's calculated events take us by surprise ; ; ; 
1.000000	2.026367	lisa rinzler's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension ; 
1.000000	2.015625	it's exactly the kind of movie toback's detractors always accuse him of making ; 
1.000000	2.063721	with the dog days of august upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity ; 
1.000000	2.010254	this rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ; ; ; or if it were subtler ; ; ; or if it had a sense of humor ; 
1.000000	2.000610	takes a clunky tv-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated irish playwright , poet and drinker ; 
1.000000	2.250000	nearly every attempt at humor here is doa ; 
1.000000	2.006348	this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous ; 
1.000000	2.007812	priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal ; 
1.000000	2.032227	even with its $50-million us budget , pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture ; 
1.000000	2.026042	the characters are interesting and the relationship between yosuke and saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours ; 
1.000000	2.076172	millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry ; 
1.000000	2.069743	perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated ; 
1.000000	2.007812	in this film , aussie david caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of guy ritchie ; 
1.000000	2.015625	the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter ; 
1.000000	2.031464	this film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers ; for the rest of us , sitting through dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment ; 
1.000000	2.062500	a tedious parable about honesty and good sportsmanship ; 
1.000000	2.015625	an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike ; 
0.000000	2.006348	 ; ; ; expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape ; 
1.000000	2.187500	really dumb but occasionally really funny ; 
1.000000	2.003906	the director's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that's low on both suspense and payoff ; 
1.000000	2.000031	they threw loads of money at an idea that should've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans ; 
1.000000	2.000397	it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work ; 
1.000000	2.010742	if you're over 25 , have an iq over 90 , and have a driver's license , you should be able to find better entertainment ; 
1.000000	2.007874	 ; ; ; the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine ; 
1.000000	2.015625	one of those so-so films that could have been much better ; 
1.000000	2.006836	cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts ; 
1.000000	2.000320	schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs ; ; ; 
1.000000	2.007243	by the final whistle you're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just doesn't have big screen magic ; 
1.000000	2.007324	this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm ; 
1.000000	2.156616	though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract ; 
0.000000	2.015137	as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved ; 
1.000000	2.003906	contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing ; 
1.000000	2.001465	return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market ; 
1.000000	2.063232	on a certain base level , blue crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it ; 
1.000000	2.107422	the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder ; 
1.000000	2.000511	[soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness ; 
1.000000	2.248047	so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag ; 
1.000000	2.007812	jam-packed with literally bruising jokes ; every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked ; 
1.000000	2.027344	helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome ; 
0.000000	2.000244	at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue ; 
1.000000	2.078125	a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be ; 
1.000000	2.004395	if you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one ; 
1.000000	2.031245	this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , 'ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie ; '
1.000000	2.027344	all the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness ; 
1.000000	2.008301	elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke ; if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again ; it's 51 times better than this ; 
1.000000	2.015567	despite its promising cast of characters , big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that 'zany' doesn't necessarily mean 'funny ; '
1.000000	2.003967	just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting ; there are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills ; 
1.000000	2.007675	there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title ; 
1.000000	2.062500	go , girls , right down the reality drain ; 
1.000000	2.005859	can be classified as one of those 'alternate reality' movies ; ; ; except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality ; 
1.000000	2.000122	just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that's neither original nor terribly funny ; 
0.000000	2.006836	it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense ; 
1.000000	2.025391	why would anyone cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ? 
1.000000	2.006104	presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency ; 
1.000000	2.050774	we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat ; 
1.000000	2.014893	a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless ; 
1.000000	2.001953	an amalgam of the fugitive , blade runner , and total recall , only without much energy or tension ; 
0.000000	2.067139	with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it's-good camp ; 
1.000000	2.210938	the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat ; 
1.000000	2.015503	much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché ; 
1.000000	2.122559	with an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing jackson ) and subject matter , the improbable " formula 51 " is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger ; 
1.000000	2.074448	adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service ; '
1.000000	2.121094	behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting ; quelle surprise ! 
1.000000	2.002930	scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle ; 
1.000000	2.031273	the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era ; they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way ; 
1.000000	2.000763	one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation ; 
1.000000	2.007812	there's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies ; 
1.000000	2.033203	the movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive ; 
1.000000	2.079671	well made but uninvolving , bloodwork isn't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery ; 
1.000000	2.000245	so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter's the thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat ; 
1.000000	2.012370	it's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who doesn't think about percentages all day long ; 
1.000000	2.003876	ken russell would love this ; in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout  and meat loaf explodes ; 
1.000000	2.001953	the premise of " abandon " holds promise , ; ; ; but its delivery is a complete mess ; 
1.000000	2.125000	its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche ; 
1.000000	2.031250	a big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on ; 
1.000000	2.046867	the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage ; 
1.000000	2.003906	what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of variety ; 
1.000000	2.117188	a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt ; 
1.000000	2.000244	a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks ; 
1.000000	2.078125	a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted ; 
1.000000	2.003906	there is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew ; 
1.000000	2.003662	even if it made its original release date last fall , it would've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness ; 
1.000000	2.062500	only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience ; 
1.000000	2.014893	 ; ; ; liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario ; too bad ;

1.000000	2.003784	reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition ; it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down ; 
1.000000	2.054626	if this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it ; 
1.000000	2.007812	a superfluous sequel ; ; ; plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find ; 
1.000000	2.039062	the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value ; 
1.000000	2.001038	the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil ; 
1.000000	2.178874	her fans walked out muttering words like " horrible " and " terrible , " but had so much fun dissing the film that they didn't mind the ticket cost ; in this case zero ; 
1.000000	2.015625	when it comes to the battle of hollywood vs ; woo , it looks like woo's a p ; o ; w ; 
1.000000	2.150879	content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance ; 
1.000000	2.001404	it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread ; 
1.000000	2.000122	if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh ; 
1.000000	2.003906	what might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors ; 
1.000000	2.000488	has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick ; 
1.000000	2.001953	like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen ; 
1.000000	2.140625	what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears' first movie ; 
1.000000	2.022583	city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for ; but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery ; 
1.000000	2.064880	the kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea ;

1.000000	2.245850	to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy ;

1.000000	2.003906	wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste ; 
1.000000	2.032227	one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot ; 
1.000000	2.007828	a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised ; 
1.000000	2.126953	one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily ;

1.000000	2.004089	it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story ;

1.000000	2.062500	a nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent ; 
1.000000	2.062744	with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral ;

0.000000	2.023438	sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours ;

1.000000	2.066406	anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity ; 
1.000000	2.001709	what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature ;

1.000000	2.057983	swimfan , like fatal attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub ;

1.000000	2.023438	like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable ; 
1.000000	2.014648	when in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip ; or else a doggie winks ; 
1.000000	2.001465	despite the surface attractions -- conrad l ; hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything ; 
1.000000	2.125000	go for la salle's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script ; 
1.000000	2.015595	it's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress ;

0.000000	2.066406	ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok ; 
1.000000	2.060791	releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them ; 
1.000000	2.015625	this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows ; 
1.000000	2.007812	though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it's exploitive without being insightful ; 
1.000000	2.030762	even with harris's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe lear's soul-stripping breakdown ;

1.000000	2.046875	turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film's characters
1.000000	2.001221	high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd ; 
1.000000	2.001221	the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his ;

1.000000	2.004883	in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works ; 
1.000000	2.015625	the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue ; 
1.000000	2.015381	dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation ; 
1.000000	2.027344	an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten ; 
1.000000	2.004517	what could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination ;

1.000000	2.019531	it's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name ; 
1.000000	2.031250	a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions ; 
1.000000	2.003906	some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling ; 
1.000000	2.031250	the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay ; 
1.000000	2.027481	on its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of monsters , inc ; , without the latter's imagination , visual charm or texture ; 
1.000000	2.003910	after a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky ;

1.000000	2.033203	it's sweet ; ; ; but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end ;

0.000000	2.066406	an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people ; ; ; manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy ; 
1.000000	2.001953	instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the x games , we get a cinematic postcard that's superficial and unrealized ; 
0.000000	2.023438	the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise ;

1.000000	2.000977	an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald's , let alone some savvy street activism ;
